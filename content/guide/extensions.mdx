Extensions allow you to add new actions to Xpop, expanding its functionality. You can install pre-built extensions or even create custom ones to suit your needs.

Manage your extensionsâ€”configure, rearrange, or remove them in Xpop's settings.

## Installing a snippet

Like Popclip, Xpop allows extensions to be loaded directly from a unique plain text format known as a "snippet". Snippets are ideal for quickly creating extensions and sharing them in plain text format, eliminating the need to create a separate file.

Here is an example snippet for an extension that searches Wikipedia for the selected text:

```yaml
# xpop Wiktionary search with subdomain option
name: Wiktionary
icon: iconify:ooui:logo-wiktionary
url: https://{popclip option subdomain}.wiktionary.org/wiki/{popclip text}
options:
  - type: string
    identifier: subdomain
    label: Site subdomain
    defaultValue: en
```

To install that, you select the text and then click the action Install Extension "Wikipedia" that appears in the Xpop bar.

<Callout type="info">
  Notice that the first line of the snippet starts with **# xpop** or
  **#popclip**. This is a special marker that tells Xpop that this is a snippet.
