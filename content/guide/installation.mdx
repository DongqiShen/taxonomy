### Why is Accessibility permission needed?

Xpop relies on macOS's Accessibility API to function, which allows it to read the text you highlight in other apps. This feature is essential for Xpop to work, so enabling Accessibility permissions is required to use the tool.

Xpop only accesses the text you select through the Accessibility API and processes everything locally on your Mac. Your selected text is never stored, shared, or sent anywhere unless you intentionally trigger an action that requires internet access, like searching the web.
